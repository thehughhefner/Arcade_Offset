        [Function]

            ・ Second loop Unlocked.

            ・ At the beginning of the second loop, the jewel counter is doubled.

            ・ Several changes occur during the second loop compared to the first:

            ・ The player cannot earn score extend anymore.
            ・ The position and number of enemies is not exactly the same as in the first loop.
            ・ When killed, the enemies will release revenge bullets aimed toward the player (but not completely straight at them).
            ・ Several bosses will have additional phases and attacks.
            ・ You respawn in place after a death instead of starting at the beginning of the stage
            ・ Bomb usage has changed.
            ・ Aircraft speeds for the player are faster.
            ・ The scoring system is altered from the second loop; gunner mines diamonds and pilot mines rings. Points accrue for killing enemies in addition to the counter.
